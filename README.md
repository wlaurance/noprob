Why?
----
Having a utility that can restart or recompile or reconfigure or re*whatever* whenever you change a file can be incredibly convenient.  Many programs of this sort are geared to work with a specific toolchain or tend to be overly complicated for what should be a simple task.

No worries.  Noprob's got your back, no problem.
